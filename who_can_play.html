<h3>Who Can Play?</h3>
<p>There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week.</p>

<p>Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.<br>
    Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who<br>
    want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit without pushing them to their limit.</p>

<p>For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be<br>
    really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.</p>
<p>Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.</p>
