<h3>About Volleyball</h3>
<p>Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net.</p>
<p><br>
    The sport originated in the United States, and is now just achieving the type of popularity<br>
    in the U.S. that it has received on a global basis, where it ranks behind only soccer among<br>
    participation sports. There are 800 million players worldwide who play Volleyball at least once a week.</p>
<p><br>
    The object of the game is for each team to send the ball regularly over the net to ground it<br>
    on the opponent's court, and to prevent the ball from being grounded on its own court. The ball<br>
    is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net<br>
    to the opponent's court.</p>

<p><br>
    A team is allowed to hit the ball three times (in addition to the block contact) to return it<br>
    to the opponent's court. A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except<br>
    when attempting a block. The rally continues until the ball touches the ground/floor, goes "out"<br>
    or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault.</p>
<p><br>
    The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System). When the receiving team wins a rally,<br>
    it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.</p>
<p><br>
    The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the<br>
    team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap). If there is a<br>
    deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum<br>
    two-point advantage (no scoring cap).
